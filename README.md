(Won Best Beginner's Hack by Hulu) A Girl's Reality- by Shannon Kraemer, Nithya Deepak, Amy Sorto 

A Girl's Reality is a VR Oculus and Leapmotion experience that aims to visualize a young girl who is interested in STEM's upbringing. Only 17.9% and 19.9% of computer science and engineering degrees are awarded to women, even though 74% of young girls express interest in STEM. Our project aims to bring awareness to why this problem exists, to cause change and to encourage young girls to follow their passion.
